I am a PhD student at Greifswald University under the supervision of [Ines Kath](https://math-inf.uni-greifswald.de/institut/ueber-uns/mitarbeitende/kath/). I am interested in locally homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian geometries, and in Geometric structures in general. 
My Master thesis on Apollonian circle packings (here, slides). You find here my CV (version of October 2023).
 I am currently co-organizing the Tassili Sunday Maths Seminar (here) and the Research Seminar at Greifswald University (here).
